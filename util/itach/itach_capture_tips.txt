The IR Blaster is best for applications that transmit IR commands across a 
room.  Emitters are best stuck onto the IR eye of a device for individual 
control.

When done collecting sendir commands in itach_codes.cmd, run the perl script 
itach_header.pl > ..\..\agent\remote\itach.h to generate the c language 
header file used by the remote control agent and the itach demo.exe utility.  

Note the format of the itach_codes.cmd file:

the "rem" line defines the name of the sendir set with 3 subsequent sendir lines:
rem <header file variable name>
sendir <tv cmd code>
sendir <dvd cmd code>
sendir <vcr cmd code>

This is a general tutorial for defining the remote control agent itach.h header
file.  Reference mcs\doc\itach\itach_api.pdf for in depth information.  
Section "5.4.6 Sending IR" is the best resource for complete sendir specification 
information.

The following example is intended to illustrate capturing a single sendir 
command for the itach_codes.cmd file.  

First, some sendir background is needed.  The sendir command is defined by:

sendir,<connectorAddress>,<id>,<frequency>,<repeat>,<offset>,<on cycles>,<off cycles>,...<on cycles><large off cycles>

connectorAddress: Plugging the blaster into the rightmost port is defined as 1:3 (module 1, connector 3)
              id: not significant to the remote control agent.  making this unique may aid troubleshooting
       frequency: determined by iLearn
          repeat: 2 works well without detecting duplicates
          offset: used to not resend the preamble.  look for a repeating pattern to determine offset.


Capturing IR Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run iLearn.exe
set IR Learner pull down to "iTach Learner"
set the IP Address (hostname works)
Connect
set the Capture options Connector to match the jack the blaster is plugged
(rightmost jack is Connector 3)
point the IR remote at the hole to right of the DC power jack.
iLearn should capture the code in the "Learned Code" dialog:
Note: if no ir codes are detected, hold a button down while pointing at the 
      receiver should kick the itach device into learning mode 
Edit to copy the Learned Code into the Edit View dialog
Send IR to confirm the captured IR code works
select all the text in the "Edit View" dialog and paste those codes into the 
relevant section in the itach_codes.cmd file

sendir,1:3,1,40192,1,1,
97,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,1032,
97,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,1033,
97,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,1034,
97,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,5144

This capture repeats the <on cycles> <off cycles> ... lines 1 time with an 
offset of 1.


Confirming Captured Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run iTest.exe 
Set the IP Address
Connect
check "Add Carriage Return"
Paste the sendir command into the "Command String" dialog box and click Send.

This should transmit the IR code to the device for confirmation. 

Run "mcs\agent\remote\rcAgentConsole.exe -d" to launch the remote control agent
in debug mode.  Assuming the tira device initializes correctly it will print out 
received IR codes from an iTest send:
 
irRx match found 16.57.58: 231700000000 -> ir vcr power
irRx discarding duplicate 16.57.58: 231700000000 -> ir vcr power

In this case the tira sees one duplicate from the captured irSend command.
The captured sendir command can be shortened and condensed to just repeat 
the second line of <on cycles> <off cycles> to 2 times:

sendir,1:3,1,40192,2,1,
97,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,23,49,23,25,23,25,23,25,1032

This results in the remote control agent getting a callback with a consistent 
ir code:

irRx match found 16.58.14: 231700000000 -> ir vcr power

If the shortened command is intended to control a device it should also be
tested to confirm it still works.
